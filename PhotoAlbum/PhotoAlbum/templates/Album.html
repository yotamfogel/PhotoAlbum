                        <p>
                            10 years ago Derek Fisher gave us one of the greatest and most unlikely game-winners in NBA Playoff History. After Tim Duncan had hit a shot to give the Spurs a one-point lead in a playoffs game 5 with 0.4 seconds left, Fisher hit the biggest shot of his career.

                        Damian Lillard hit one of the most crazy and important game winners in the history of the NBA.
                        Lillard hit a fading 3pt shot from 37 foot over Paul George to win the game for the Blazers.
                        The clip of the game winner has gone viral with a lot of people trying to copy it since.

                            Game 7 of the NBA Semi-Finals was tied between the raptors and the 76ers 90-90. With 4.2 seconds left Kawhi took the ball and faded a 3 from the corner. The ball bounced on the rim a couple of times and went in a play that made all Raptors fans go crazy in the stadium. Later Kawhi carried the Raptors to the win in the finals against the Warriors.

                            The Utah Jazz had 2.8 seconds to break a 100-100 tie in Game 6 of the Western Conference Finals, and the legendary passer made a legendary shot. Rockets forward Charles Barkley tried to contest the three-pointer, but Stockton stepped into a clean look after receiving the inbound pass and taking one dribble. The buzzer-beater handed his team a 4-2 series victory and sent the Jazz to their first-ever NBA Finals.

                            Lebron caught an inbound pass with exactly one second remaining. He then drilled a fadeaway three to stun the Magic and even the series. Later he went on to win one of his many MVP awards that year.
